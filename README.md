# React with Redux [2019 update]

This is a repo created only to store my files developed during classes of the course 
[React with Redux \[2019 update\]](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) on Udemy, 
for easy access across my machines.

I tried to commit every exercise/lesson that seemed to be important for the understanding
of React usage, as doing so helps my retention of the content being studied and stays as
a history to check later if I need to remember something that was done during this course.
